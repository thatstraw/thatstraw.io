What is a network - A computer network is a  digital telecommunication network which allows nodes to share resources. A node is any device connected to the network. For example, router, switch, client, server, etc. 

## Network Device

- Client - A client  in simple terms is a device that access a service made available by the server.
- server - a server is a device that provides functions or services to a client.
- switch - switches are used to forward traffic within a Local Area Network(LAN).
- routers - routers are used to forward traffic over different LANs.
- firewalls - firewalls are special network security devices that controls traffic entering and exiting your network.

## Characteristics of switches

- switches have many network interfaces/ports for end hosts to connect to (usually 24+)
- switches provide connectivity to hosts within the same Local Area Network(LAN)
- switches do no provide connectivity between LANs or over the internet.

## Characteristics of switches

- routers have few network interfaces than switches.
- routers provide connectivity between different LANs
- routers are used to send data over the internet.

## Characteristics of firewalls

- monitor and control network traffic based on configured rules.
- can place inside the network or outside the network
- are called “next generation firewalls” when they include advanced and modern filtering capabilities.
- they exists in two forms, that is network firewalls(hardware firewalls) and host-based firewalls (software firewalls)
- Network firewalls are hardware firewalls that filter traffic between networks
- host-based-firewalls - are software firewalls that filters traffic entering and leaving host machine, like a PC.
